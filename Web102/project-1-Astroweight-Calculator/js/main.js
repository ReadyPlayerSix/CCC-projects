// set the #calculate-button element's onclick method to use the handleClickEvent function
// make it look nice by attaching a style.css file to your index.html and writing some basic styling
// feel free to add classes and id's to the HTML elements as you need
// import a google font and use it for some or all of the text on your page

// bonus challenge
// reverse the drop down order so that the sun is first

// personal notes
// include filter options for showing drop down order in distance from the sun
// include toggle filter option for dwarf planets
// include menu for adding new planets, name and weight multiplier
// try styling with a different style library such as Bulma or Materialize for a modern look
